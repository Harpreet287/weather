# weatherApp in Flutter

This was my first Flutter(& dart) project.

It fetches and displays the weather according to your location.
Uses openweathermap.org api key

## To run it on simulator(on macos):
```
flutter pub add http
flutter pub add geolocator
flutter pub add geocoding
flutter pub add lottie
open -a simulator
flutter run
```
